## Overview

Canisters contain both code and state. Once you have written the code for a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip>, the canister doesn't exist until it is registered with ICP, either locally, on the playground, or on the mainnet.

## Creating canisters

Canisters are created with [`dfx canister create`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-create). They are initially empty and do not contain program code. The code must be compiled into Wasm and installed into the empty canister before it can be deployed.

Create your canisters from within the project's directory:

- `dfx canister create hello_world`: Create a canister locally.

- `dfx canister create hello_world --network=playground`: Create a canister on the playground.

- `dfx canister create hello_world --network=ic`: Create a canister on the mainnet.

- `dfx canister create --all --network=ic`: Create all canisters in the project's `dfx.json` file.

:::caution
Creating a canister on the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-faucet).
:::

::tip
Settings can be configured for a canister using optional flags. [View the full list of settings that can be configured](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#options-1).
:::

When a canister is created, the following steps happen:

- A canister ID is registered with the local replica or the mainnet for each canister in the project's `dfx.json` file.

- The following canister components are created:
  - List of controllers.
  - Cycles balance.
  - Reserved cycles balance.
  - Canister status.
  - Resource reservations.

- Each canister ID is returned in the command line.
