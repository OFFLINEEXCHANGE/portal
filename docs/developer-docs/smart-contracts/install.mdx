# Install

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

When a <GlossaryTooltip>canister</GlossaryTooltip> has been initially created, it is empty and does not contain code or state. It only contains information such as the settings, canister ID, cycles balance, and controllers. [Learn more about creating a canister](/docs/current/developer-docs/smart-contracts/create).

## Installing canister code

Code must be installed into a canister using the [`dfx canister install`](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#dfx-canister-install) command:

- `dfx canister install hello_world`: Install canister code locally.

- `dfx canister install hello_world --network=playground`: Install canister code on the playground.

- `dfx canister install hello_world --network=ic`: Install canister code on the mainnet.

- `dfx canister install --all --network=ic`: Install code for all canisters in the project's `dfx.json` file.

:::caution
Installing code in a canister on the mainnet will cost [cycles](/docs/current/developer-docs/getting-started/cycles/cycles-faucet)
:::

::tip
Settings can be configured for a canister using optional flags. [View the full list of settings that can be configured](/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/cli-reference/dfx-canister#options-1).
:::

When a canister's code is installed, the following components are created:

- The canister's code in the form of a canister module.

- The canister's state, including the canister's memory and global values.

- Additional IC-specific information, such as the canister's input and output queues.

## Installing a gzip-compressed WebAssembly module

The size of programs that can be installed on ICP is currently limited to 2 MiB.
WebAssembly modules that are (slightly) larger than 2 MiB can still be installed on ICP by using gzip file compression before uploading; ICP will then decompress the file and install the contained WebAssembly module.

The WebAssembly module is compressed using `gzip` and then uploaded by `dfx canister install`, you may need to add `--mode reinstall` or `--mode upgrade` when uploading the module to an existing canister.

``` bash
gzip my-canister.wasm
dfx canister install my-canister --wasm my-canister.wasm.gz
```

Compression is currently not supported by `dfx deploy`.
